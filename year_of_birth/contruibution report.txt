 Overview

This program collects user input for their name, age, and favorite number, providing feedback based on each input.
It includes error handling for invalid inputs and conditional statements to categorize the favorite number. 
The program also calculates the user’s birth year based on their age and determines if the favorite number is even or odd.
Contributions

Each group member contributed equally to the development and testing phases of this project. The tasks were divided as follows:
1. Olema Swaib

    Worked on implementing the input prompts and managing the error handling for non-numeric values in the age and favorite number inputs.
    Helped with setting up the calculation of the birth year and ensuring that the logic was clear and accurate.
    Participated actively in the final testing to ensure that all input types were handled smoothly.

2. Atukunda Shanita

    Focused on designing and structuring the conditional statements, especially those related to determining if the favorite number was even or odd and checking its range.
    Added additional user feedback for "small," "large," and "very large" favorite number conditions.
    Contributed equally in testing, focusing on edge cases like boundary numbers (e.g., 10 and 100) and invalid inputs.

3. Kizza Gertrude

    Developed the input prompt for the name and created the greeting message to ensure user engagement.
    Provided assistance in formatting the output messages and making the user interface friendly.
    Was actively involved in testing, paying special attention to the user’s experience, and validating that all outputs were as expected.
